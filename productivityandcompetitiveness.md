# productivity and competitiveness

Git is a great medium to save your work and collaborate code changes in a group. Git can be accessed anywhere in the
world, making today's global teams's collaboration much easier. Recently, more and more companies are promoting Agile 
work culture, where continuous integration is the key. The benefits of continuous integration includes customer 
satisfaction, fault isolation, smaller backlog, increase team transparency, More test reliability. In this, customer 
satisfaction is the key, when the customer feels involved in the development process they can provide meaningful feedback.
Sometimes customers are not able to predict all the features necessary, and all the final workflows at the requirement 
gathering phase, in a continuous integration method they are able to provide input based on each iteration of code change.
Customers can correct minute mistakes, or any gap in programmer's understanding of the requirement before the final 
product is released. Git can be a great medium for collaboration, because when these bug fixes are necessary, and the 
teams are large or widespread, each person can upload their own addition of features as a new branch, and each branch can
be corrected for fixing bugs. The branching system in Git is an excellent way for releasing versions of code as well. 
Before code integration into Github, it is best practice to test your own code change on Docker. 
The Makefile will pull down any required packages or dependencies, then it will clone the GitHub repo, build,
and launch the application.
